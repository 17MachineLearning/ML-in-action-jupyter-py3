# Machine Learning in Action - Jupyter (python 3)



*Machine Learning in Action* is a great introductory book when I first explore this subject, giving a fabulous python practice for us. The source code is already on GitHub: https://github.com/pbharrin/machinelearninginaction.



However, the source code is written in Python 2.7. I only have Python 3.6.2 installed on my laptop, so I decide to rewrite it on Python 3.



Additionally, Jupyter Notebook is a powerful tool to display the results of machine learning algorithms. My code is in the form of .ipynb therefore.



Some titles may be written in Chinese because I mainly saw the Chinese version of the book. I will put on an English version soon. (Though you can fully understand what I mean because the numbers of chapters are clear.)
